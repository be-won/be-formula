Good SEO does not require tricks. Clear titles and structure help both readers and search engines.

## Title and Meta Description

- **Title**: Include the main topic and keep it under 60 characters. Make it specific.
- **Description**: Write a short summary (around 150 characters) that encourages clicks. Use the main keyword naturally.

## Content Structure

Use one H1 (usually the post title), then H2 for sections and H3 for subsections. This creates a clear outline and helps indexing.

## Internal Links

Link to your other posts when relevant. Internal links help users discover more content and help search engines understand your site.

## Summary

Focus on a clear title, a useful meta description, and logical headings. Consistency and clarity matter more than keyword stuffing.
