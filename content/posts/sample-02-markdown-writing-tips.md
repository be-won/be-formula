Markdown keeps writing simple while giving enough structure for the web.

## Use Clear Headings

Use one H1 per page (often the title). Use H2 for main sections and H3 for subsections. This helps both readers and search engines.

## Lists and Code

- Use bullet lists for options or steps.
- Use numbered lists when order matters.

Use fenced code blocks for commands or code so they stand out and can be copied easily.

## Summary

Good Markdown habits make your content easier to scan and maintain. Keep headings logical and formatting consistent.
