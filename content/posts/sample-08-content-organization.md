A simple, consistent structure makes your blog easier to navigate and maintain.

## Folders and Sections

In Hugo, `content/posts/` is a section. Files there are listed as posts. You can add more sections (e.g. `content/notes/`) if you need different types of content.

## Categories and Tags

- **Categories**: Broad groups (e.g. "web", "writing"). Use a few per site; they often map to menus or section pages.
- **Tags**: Specific topics (e.g. "hugo", "seo"). Use several per post for filtering and related content.

Set them in front matter. Many themes show category and tag pages automatically.

## File Names and Slugs

Use short, readable file names or set `slug` in front matter for clean URLs. Avoid spaces and special characters. Consistency helps users and SEO.

## Summary

Clear sections, a few categories, and relevant tags improve both organization and findability. Start simple and refine as you add more posts.
